I am a gamer, a computer science major, and an aspiring reverse engineer. I originally went to college for music production, but I became very interested in Linux. I use Linux as my daily driver and I am currently building my own custom operating system entirely from source code. I learned about reverse engineering through GBA ROM hacks. Now, I spent my days prepping for collegiate cyber competitions, attending college, and posting to this blog.
